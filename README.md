# Insight
Allows doctors to use computer vision to scan a patient's face and pull up medical information from a database
Meant for every situation ranging from ER to physicals
Built using: OpenCV, Face Recognition API, Python, Flask and Mlabs

There are multiple OpenCV files cuz I wanted to test the CV worked without some other parts like the DB, for example.
The CV works in well lit areas (you can just shine a light on ur face, I used a phone flashlight and it worked like a dream)
